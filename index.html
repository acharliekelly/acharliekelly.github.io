          <div class="container flow-text">
            <p>I'm a software engineer based in Boston, MA.</p>
            <h4>TL;DR</h4>
            <p>
              Recently got back into development after several years in non-profit IT management
            </p>
            <h4>Longer</h4>
            <p>
              My development career began in the late 90s, playing around with Excel spreadsheets and disovering
              all the things you could do with macros. That led to learning VBA, and then to building several applications
              based on MS Access. In one instance, I created an Access-based solution for a data entry job I was doing,
              and ended up eliminating the need for my position. I saw it as a win, but the staffing agency I was nominally
              working for was less thrilled.</p>
            <p>So I got a job making database applications instead. My next job was writing small applications in VB and MS Office to
              interact with the company's Oracle 9i database. Later, that same company switched to Java, so I re-wrote all those applications
              as JSP-based web apps.</p>
            <p>I spent several years working as a Java developer, tending towards front-end work. My last job in that field was as
              principal UI developer for 2 major commercial releases of an enterprise network security platform. My key contribution was to
              eliminate one legacy component: the platform's navigation system was a 5MB Java applet, which needed to be loaded before the
              app would run. I replaced this with a set of asynchronous JSF components, dramatically improving performance while also making
              it possible to run our platform on a PlayStation (because apparently there was a need for that within our customer base).</p>
            <p>Around that time, the economy imploded, and the company I was with suddenly had no need for engineers (or employees).
              So I tried my hand at some related fields, such as designing websites for small business and non-profit clients.
              One of my non-profit clients had an upcoming database development project that sounded interesting, so I signed on with them.
              The next thing I knew, I had morphed from Dev to DevOps to just Ops, and there was a lot of Ops.</p>
            <p>I made a couple of attempts at returning to full-time development, but my engineering skills took a hit in the interim.
              By then, Java had evolved significantly from where I last saw it, and even my familiar versioning tools (CVS and SubVersion) had
              all been replaced by Git.</p>
            <p>Then I came across General Assembly, which offered the perfect solution for me: an intensive training course designed to teach some
              of the latest, hottest tools in the field, to get me caught up with all the things I'd missed (eg, what exactly does <em>Agile</em> mean?).</p>
            <p>I learned a bunch of new skills, like Rails, Node, and React; plus I can handle Git from the command line in my sleep. I also
              got to collaborate on group projects, which is something I was sorely missing in my latest role where I was typically the <em>only</em>
              technical person on site. </p>
            <p>Since finishing the GA bootcamp, I've been doing mostly freelance and volunteer work to hone my skills, particularly
              with NodeJS and ReactJS. You can see some of my recent <a href="#projects">projects</a> below.</p>

                  <p>Memomy Game in React/Redux</p>
                  <p>
                    My very first project for GA was an excruciatingly simple memory game tutorial.
                    About a year later, for an interesting learning experience, I re-wrote
                    the game as a React/Redux project. The original project had 4 cards based on
                    preset images. This one has more features.
